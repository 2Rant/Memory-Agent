This is explicitly mentioned in the memories.\n\n2. **April 2023**: \n   - You flew with **American Airlines** from your hometown to **Honolulu** and then took a connecting flight to **Maui** during your vacation from **April 20 to April 27**.\n\nNow, let's summarize the flights:\n- **Southwest Airlines**: 1 flight in March (to Las Vegas).\n- **American Airlines**: 1 flight in April (to Honolulu and Maui).\n\nSince you have one flight with each airline during the specified months, it appears that you did not fly with one airline more than the other in March and April. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that you flew with **both Southwest Airlines and American Airlines equally** in March and April.",
